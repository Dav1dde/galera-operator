# Installation guide

Galera operator is made of two stateless controllers packaged in the same binary.

## Create new galera resources

Kubernetes provides a logical view through **Resources**. Resources are mainly declarative, the requested state is described through the **Spec** field. The current state of a Resource is described in the **Status** field. Resources are managed with **Controllers**. Controllers are designed to reconcile and take actions to bring the observed state to the requested state.

Galera operator is a set of new controllers in charge of new resources. To add new resources to an existing Kubernetes cluster, it uses Custom Resource Definition (CRD)

```bash
$ kubectl create -f example-manifests/galera-crd/galera-crd.yaml
$ kubectl create -f example-manifests/galera-crd/galerabackup-crd.yaml
...
$ kubectl api-resources
NAME                              SHORTNAMES   APIGROUP                       NAMESPACED   KIND
...
priorityclasses                   pc           scheduling.k8s.io              false        PriorityClass
galerabackups                     gb           sql.databases                  true         GaleraBackup
galeras                           gl           sql.databases                  true         Galera
...
```

The two new resources are **Namespaced**, meaning the resources must be attached to a specified **Namespace**.

## Install galera operator

Create if needed a namespace for deploying galera operator:

```bash
$ kubectl create -f  example-manifests/galera-operator/0-namespace.yaml
```

Galera operator needs a **Service Account** to access the Kubernetes API

```bash
$ kubectl create -f example-manifests/galera-operator/operator-sa.yaml
```

### Galera operator scope

Galera operator can be deployed to only manage galera clusters created in the same namespace. It is possible to deploy a galera operator with special option to manage clusterwide galera clusters.

### 1. Managing galera clusters in the same namespace

Create **Role** and use **RoleBinding** bind the service account with the role:

```bash
$ kubectl create -f example-manifests/galera-operator/role.yaml
$ kubectl create -f example-manifests/galera-operator/role-binding.yaml
````

Galera operator is deployed using a **Deployment**

``bash
$ kubectl create -f example-manifests/galera-operator/operator-deployment.yaml
```



### 2. Managing Clusterwide galera clusters

Create **ClusterRole** and use **ClusterRoleBing** to bind it with the service account:

```bash
$ kubectl create -f example-manifests/galera-operator/cluster-role.yaml
$ kubectl create -f example-manifests/galera-operator/cluster-role-binding.yaml
```

To manage galera clusters in all namespaces, galera operator have to run with `-cluster-wide` arg option. You can edit the operator-deploymnet.yaml file and modify it.

```bash
$ kubectl create -f example-manifests/galera-operator/operator-deployment.yaml
```

## Uninstall galera operator

Note that the galera clusters managed by galera operator will **NOT** be deleted even if the operator is uninstalled.

This is an intentional design to prevent accidental operator failure from killing all the galera clusters.

To delete all clusters, delte all cluster Custom Resource objects before uninstalling the operator.

Clean up galera operator:

```bash
$ kubectl delete -f  example-manifests/galera-operator/operator-deployment.yaml
```

## Installation using Helm

Today, no Helm chart is available to deploy galera operator.
